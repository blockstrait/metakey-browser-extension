The MetaKey extension allows websites to sign Bitcoin SV transactions without having direct access to the keys.

Every website can request the user to perform certain operations on an independent set of keys generated for that particular website.

This software should be considered beta, and therefore only used to sign transactions with small amounts of BSV.
